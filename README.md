# Search_Random_LegalAction
 The main goal of this project is to search of a legal action that does not exist just to practice selenium web elements.

 You should choose a city to search this legal action. After that it is required to insert a name, a lawyer and a number of the legal action. The pop up that will show up after is random so the legal action number it can be found or not.

 The main purpose of this coding is to practice different elements of selenium such as find element,send keys and ActionChains-and its elements.
